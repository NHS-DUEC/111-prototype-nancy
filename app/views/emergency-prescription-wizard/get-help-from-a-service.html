    <h1>We’ve found services that can help</h1>
    <p>
      A pharmacist or nurse will ask you some questions. They’ll:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>check your records for what you’ve been prescribed before</li>
      <li>decide if it’s safe to give you the medicine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Emergency prescriptions can cost more</h2>
    <p>
      You might have to pay, even if you don’t normally.
      Prices can vary and NHS pre-payment cards may not be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some pharmacies charge standard NHS prices. If there's one in your
      area you can refer yourself.
