    <p>
      The pharmacist or clinician will make a decision about whether it is safe
      to supply you with the medicine. This will be based on the information
      they have and their own assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll be asked for your name, age and postcode to help to find your NHS
      number and your summary care record. If you give permission to view your
      summary care record it should show any medicines you’ve been prescribed
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might have to pay for your medicine and prices can vary. Some
      pharmacists only charge standard NHS prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s helpful if you have a list of all the medicines you take, and the
      dose, if you know that. Or gather old boxes if you have any. If you don’t
      know all the details of what you take that’s ok.
