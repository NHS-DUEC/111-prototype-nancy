    <h1>We’ve found services that can help</h1>
    <p>
      A pharmacist or nurse will ask you some questions. They’ll:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>check your records for what you’ve been prescribed before</li>
      <li>decide if it’s safe to give you the medicine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It’s helpful if you can take a list of all your medicines and the doses
      with you if you know that.
    </p>
    <h2>Emergency prescriptions can be more expensive</h2>
    <p>
      You might have to pay for your medicine even if you don’t normally. Prices can vary and NHS pre-payment cards may not be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some pharmacists are working with the NHS to only charge standard NHS prices.
