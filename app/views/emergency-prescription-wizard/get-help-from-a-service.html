    <h1>Services near you that can help</h1>
    <h2>What happens when you get there</h2>
    <p>
      The pharmacist or nurse will decide if it’s safe to give you the medicine.
      This will be based on the information they have and questions they will
      ask you.
    </p>
    <h2>Information they need</h2>
    <p>
      To help find your NHS number and your summary care record you’ll be asked
      for your:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>postcode</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you agree they can view your summary care record it should show the
      medicines you’ve been prescribed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t have an NHS number because you’re visiting the UK, take a
      list of all your medicines and the dose if you know that. Or if you have
      any old boxes take those with you.
    </p>
    <h2>Paying for medicine</h2>
    <p>
      You might have to pay for your medicine and prices can vary. Some
      pharmacists only charge standard NHS prices.
