    <div>
      <p>
        It’s safe to wait a bit longer as this is not an emergency. If you’re
        worried call 999. This doesn’t mean an ambulance will be sent straight
        away - but they’ll tell you what to do next.
      </p>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I miss the call?</summary>
    <div>
      <p>
        A nurse will try and ring you up to 3 times. If they can’t speak to you
        they may send emergency services to make sure you’re ok.

      <p>Call 999.</p>
