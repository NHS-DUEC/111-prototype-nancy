    You and your family need to stay at home

    <p>
      To protect others, <b>do not go</b> to a GP, pharmacy or hospital
    </p>

      Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">To avoid spreading infection</h2>

  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">
    If you live alone, do not leave your home for 7 days
  </h3>
  <p>
    Do not leave your home for 7 days from when your symptoms started, however
    mild they are.
  </p>

  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">
    If you live with other people, keep everyone at home for 14 days
  </h3>
  <p>
    The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house
    became ill.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is likely that people living within a household will infect
    each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly
    reduce the spread of infection to others in the community.
  </p>

  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">
    Vulnerable people
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you can, move any vulnerable people (the elderly and those with underlying
    health conditions) out of your home, for the whole isolation period.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cannot do this, stay away from vulnerable people as much as possible.
  </p>

    worse, use the 111 online service again. Call 999 in an emergency.
