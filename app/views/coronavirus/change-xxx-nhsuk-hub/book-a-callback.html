  <p>
    A nurse from the COVID clinical response service needs to speak to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you book a call the nurse will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>know the answers you have already given</li>
    <li>ask you some more questions about your symptoms and current health</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Itâ€™s important that you speak to the nurse. You should get a call within [NUM]
    hours. The 111 service is busy, so it could take longer than usual.
  </p>
