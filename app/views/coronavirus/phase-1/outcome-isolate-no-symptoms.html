  <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-l">You need to isolate yourself and stay indoors</h1>
  <p>For 14 days you should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>stay at home</li>
    <li>not go to work, school or public areas</li>
    <li>not use public transport or taxis</li>
    <li>
      ask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands
      for you
    </li>
    <li>
      try to avoid visitors to your home - itâ€™s OK for friends, family or
      delivery drivers to drop off food

    help reduce the possible spread of infection.
