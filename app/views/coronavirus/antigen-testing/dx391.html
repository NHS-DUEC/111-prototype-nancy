    <p>
      Your symptoms suggest that you could have a coronavirus infection.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Do not leave your home if you have symptoms or live with
    someone who does.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is called self-isolation. Self-isolation is for people with symptoms
    and is different to social distancing, which is for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are self-isolating, you must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online,
      or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
    </li>
    <li>
      not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can use your garden, if you have one. Any exercise should be done at home.
  </p>
