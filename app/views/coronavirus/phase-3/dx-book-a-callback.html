  <h1>Book a call with a 111 nurse</h1>
  <p>
    A nurse needs to speak to you so we can get you the right help.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you book a call the nurse will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>know the answers you have already given (if known)</li>
    <li>ask you some questions about your symptoms and current health</li>
    <li>tell you how to get a swab test if you need one</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Itâ€™s important that you speak to the nurse. You should get a call within XX
    hours. The 111 service is very busy, so it could take longer than usual.
  </p>

  <div class="callout callout--info">
    <p>
      Make sure you keep yourself separate from others in your household (self-isolate)
      until you have been contacted by the testing service.
