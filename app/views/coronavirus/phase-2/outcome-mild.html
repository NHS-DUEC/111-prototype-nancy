      <p>
        We need to ask you for some details so that we can arrange a test. But
        as your symptoms are mild you can look after yourself at home as you
        would do with normal flu.
      </p>
      <p>
        To manage your symptoms while you wait you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>take paracetamol</li>
        <li>drink plenty of water</li>
        <li>get lots of rest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should be contacted within 24 hours.
