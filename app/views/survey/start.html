    <details>
      <summary><span>If you need medical help call 111</span></summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          We don’t monitor the survey every day, and won’t see comments you leave
          about your symptoms or if you ask for medical help.

    <details>
      <summary><span>We won't know who you are from your answers</span></summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          Our survey asks you questions about using 111 online, and about what
          happened next. Everything you say is confidential.
        <p>
          If you agree to do a follow-up survey we’ll ask for your email address.
          We won’t share your email address with anyone else.

      Before you start, there are a few things you need to know:
    </p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">If you need medical help call 111</h2>
    <p>
      We don’t monitor the survey every day and won’t see comments you leave
      about your symptoms or any requests for medical help.
    </p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">You’re anonymous unless you choose not to be</h2>
    <p>
      The survey works by remembering the answers you gave to our questions and
      asking you about what happened next. Everything you say is confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you agree to do a follow up survey we’ll ask for your email. We’ll then
      be able to link your answers to your email address.

    <p>
      Our privacy policy explains how we look after your data and this applies
      to the survey too. If you’ve given us your email, we can delete all your
      survey responses if you ask us to.
