    <p>This service is for when you have run out of medicine, or a medical device, and you need it before you can get a repeat prescription.</p>
    <p>It's only for items you get regularly or have been prescribed before.</p>
    <p>If you've got enough to last until your GP is open, you should wait and contact your GP instead.</p>
