      <p>
        It’s safe to wait a bit longer as this is not an emergency. If you’re
        worried call 999. This doesn’t mean an ambulance will be sent straight
        away - but they’ll tell you what to do next.

    <summary>What happens if I miss the call?</summary>
    <div>

        may send emergency services to make sure you’re ok.
      </p>

  <details>
    <summary>What if my symptoms get worse?</summary>
    <div>
      <p>If your symptoms get worse or you don’t get a call within 30 minutes call 999.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I cancel the call?</summary>
