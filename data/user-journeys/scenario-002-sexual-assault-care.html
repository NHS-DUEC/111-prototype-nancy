    <summary>Wounds</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>When the wound is checked, you may need to be given a tetanus immunisation.</li>
        <li>
          If the wound is bleeding:
          <ul>
            <li>Use a dry dressing or a clean cloth to make a pad and press it firmly and directly onto the wound to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li>If the blood soaks through the pad, don't take it off. Place another pad on top of it and keep pressing it onto the wound.</li>
            <li>If you're helping someone else, try to keep their blood off your skin.</li>
            <li>Try to raise the limb above the level of your heart and continue to apply pressure. Don't use a tourniquet to stop the bleeding, unless one is already in place, in which case, do not remove it.</li>
            <li>If the bleeding stops, secure the pad with a bandage or sticky tape. Make sure it's firm but not too tight.</li>
            <li>Use pillows or a sling to keep the injured area raised.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the wound is not bleeding:
          <ul>
            <li>Cover it with a plaster, a non-stick dressing or a non-fluffy clean cloth.</li>
            <li>If you can, raise the injured area with pillows or a sling to above the level of the heart.</li>
            <li>If it starts to bleed again fold a cloth into a pad and press firmly, directly onto the wound to stop the bleeding.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    <summary>Medication, pain and/or fever</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to relieve pain or a fever. Don't take if you've been told not to, or you've already taken some. Read the instructions on the packet, or talk to a pharmacist.</li>
        <li>If you're pregnant: Use paracetamol. Don't use ibuprofen unless a doctor, midwife or pharmacist has advised you to.</li>
      </ul>

    <summary>Swelling, trauma</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't have anything to eat or drink before going to the hospital. A sip of water is fine, if you need to take medicine.</li>
        <li>Remove any tight clothing or jewellery from around the swelling.</li>
        <li>Wrap an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a cloth and put it on the swelling for 15-20 minutes. Repeat every 2-3 hours when you are awake.</li>
        <li>Never put ice directly on your skin and don't leave ice on while you're asleep.</li>
        <li>
          If your leg is affected:
          <ul>
            <li>Raise a swollen ankle or knee by sitting with your foot on a stool, or lying with it propped up on pillows.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If your arm or hand is affected:
          <ul>
            <li>Raise a swollen hand or wrist above the level of your heart using a sling. Use pillows in bed to raise it up.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
